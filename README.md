## Getting Started

This will help group members and outside observers navigate this repository. 

### Project Documentation

All documentents relating to the project will be posted in the root of this repository as requested.

At the end of each iteration, a release will be tagged as that iteration's number. For example, at the end of iteration 1, you will find the status of the project at that point under Releases and 1. 

### Running Source

To run the code, follow these steps:
1) (Optional, do this if step 3 has issues) Place the mdf file found in this root directory inside /Experimental/SaveNScore/SaveNScore
2) open the solution in Visual Studio, found in the Experimental/SaveNScore folder.
3) In the package manager console, use the command: update-database. This will take the migrations and setup a local instance of the DB
4) Run code in debug mode
